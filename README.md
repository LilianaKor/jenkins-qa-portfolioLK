My Jenkins Environment test automation portfolio using API fixtures and UI validations and based on Jenkins UI and API testing
# Jenkins Environment UI Automation with API Optimization

**Author**: Liliana Koretska  
**Role**: Test Automaation Engineer  
**Project**: Jenkins QA Automation (RedRoverSchool GitHub)

## Overview

This project showcases my contribution to a team-based automation initiative, where we enhanced Jenkins UI tests by replacing slow UI preconditions with efficient API setups. The automation specifically targets the *Environment* section of multi-configuration (matrix) projects in Jenkins.

---

## Problem Solved

Originally, tests relied on manual or UI-based Jenkins configuration. This caused:

- Long test execution times
- CI instability
- Unrepeatable test states

**My solution:**

- Created **API fixtures** to set up projects automatically.
- Made tests faster, atomic, and reliable.

---

## My Responsibilities

- Wrote both **API** and **UI** automated tests using `pytest`, `selenium`, and `httpx`
- Created reusable API fixtures for Jenkins project setup using XML configs
- Validated checkboxes in the Environment section:
  - Delete workspace before build
  - Use secret text(s) or file(s)
  - Add timestamps to Console Output
  - Inspect build log for scans
  - Terminate a build if it‚Äôs stuck
- Maintained Allure reports and GitHub PRs

## Sample Test Snippet

```python
@allure.title("UI: Verify 'Add timestamps to Console Output' checkbox is selected")
def test_timestamps_checkbox_selected(create_multiconfig_project_with_env_options_api, main_page):
    page = main_page.go_to_multiconfig_project_page(project_name).go_to_configure_page()
    assert page.is_elements_selected(page.Locators.TIMESTAMPS_CHECKBOX)

Result
Tests now run faster and pass reliably on CI

Each test is atomic, traceable, and uses reusable fixtures

My contributions improved the overall automation framework stability and speed
